# Aspect Ratio
A Minecraft mod that allows players to edit the game's aspect ratio. The mod adds a simple GUI screen powered by [YACL](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl), where you can either adjust a multiplier or set a fixed ratio e.g 4:3.

**Note:** This mod **only** modifies the world rendering.

It does **not** change the aspect ratio of the viewmodel, HUD, or menus. For those, please use separate mods.
