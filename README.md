# Aspect Ratio
A Minecraft mod that allows players to edit the game's aspect ratio. The mod adds a simple GUI screen powered by [YACL](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl), letting you easily adjust a multiplier for the game's aspect ratio.

**Please note** that this mod does not modify the player's view model. Please use separate mods for that.
